## Encapsulation

- in C# encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers
- access modifiers are keywords that specify the type of access to the members of a class
- access modifiers in C#
    - public (most accessible)
    - private (least accessible)
    - protected (accessible within the class and by derived classes)
    - internal (accessible within the same assembly)
    - protected internal (accessible within the same assembly and by derived classes)
    - private protected (accessible within the same assembly and by derived classes, but only if the derived class is in the same assembly)
